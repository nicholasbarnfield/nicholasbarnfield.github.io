1. N. Barnfield, R. Grondin, G. Pozzoli and R. Raquépas. *On the Ziv-Merhav theorem beyond Markovianity II: A thermodynamic Approach*.(2023). [arXiv:2312.02098 [math.PR]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02098) 
   - Abstract: *We prove asymptotic results for a modification of the cross-entropy estimator originally introduced by Ziv and Merhav in the Markovian setting in 1993. Our results concern a more general class of decoupled measures. In particular, our results imply strong asymptotic consistency of the modified estimator for all pairs of functions of stationary, irreducible, finite-state Markov chains satisfying a mild decay condition. Our approach is based on the study of a rescaled cumulant-generating function called the cross-entropic pressure, importing to information theory some techniques from the study of large deviations within the thermodynamic formalism.*

   - Abstract: *We generalize to a broader class of decoupled measures a result of Ziv and Merhav on universal estimation of the specific cross (or relative) entropy for a pair of multi-level Markov measures. The result covers pairs of suitably regular g-measures and pairs of equilibrium measures arising from the small space of interactions in mathematical statistical mechanics.*

I'm a final year undergraduate student in Honours Probability and Statistics at McGill University in Montr√©al, Canada. Over the past year and a half, I've had the privilege to work under the supervision of [Prof. Vojkan Jak≈°iƒá](https://jaksic.xyz) and [Dr. Renaud Raqu√©pas](https://renaudraquepas.github.io/index.html) in the field of entropic information theory. 

Research interests 
------
At the moment, my interests align broadly in applied mathematics in the fields of **probability**, **mathematical optimization**, and **statistics**. This being said, I have a deep and persistent fondness for **functional analysis**.  

Publications and preprints
------
N. Barnfield, R. Grondin, G. Pozzoli and R. Raqu√©pas. *On the Ziv-Merhav theorem beyond Markovianity II: A Thermodynamic Approach*. In preparation (2023).  

N. Barnfield, R. Grondin, G. Pozzoli and R. Raqu√©pas. *On the Ziv-Merhav theorem beyond Markovianity*. To appear in The Canadian Journal of Mathematics (2023). [arXiv:2310.01367 [cs.IT]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01367)

Short-term plans
------
In my last semester as an undergraduate student, I plan to continue a project under the guidance of [Prof. Tim Hoheisel](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/hoheisel/) in convex optimization related to a finite-dimensional version of the problem addressed [here](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/hoheisel/MEM_main.pdf). With any extra time, I also look forward to reading up in [Quantum Theory for Mathematicians](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-7116-5) to make up for my defficiencies in physics üòÄ.


Other interests
------
On the infrequent occasion where I am away from mathematics, one is likely to find me reading history books, playing outdoor hockey, or skiing.

I'm a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at Harvard University. Prior to coming to Harvard, I studied probability as an undergrad at McGill University --- in my hometown of Montréal --- where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Vojkan Jakšić](https://jaksic.xyz) and [Dr. Renaud Raquépas](https://renaudraquepas.github.io/index.html) in the field of entropic information theory. At Harvard, I am grateful to be advised by [Prof. Yue M. Lu](https://lu.seas.harvard.edu) in applied mathematics where my research focuses on the mathematical foundations of AI. In my work, I employ tools from classical and high-dimensional probability, and random matrix theory, to provide a rigorous understanding of phenomena in machine learning. 

Aside from my principal work mentioned above, I've recently had the pleasure of working with [Prof. Tim Hoheisel](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/hoheisel/), [Prof. Michael Friedlander](https://friedlander.io), and [Prof. James V. Burke](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~burke/) on developing robust algorithms in convex optimization.

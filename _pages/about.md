I'm a first year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at Harvard University. Prior to coming to Harvard, I did my undergad at McGill University in Honours Probability and Statistics with a minor in computer science. At McGill, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Vojkan Jakšić](https://jaksic.xyz) and [Dr. Renaud Raquépas](https://renaudraquepas.github.io/index.html) in the field of entropic information theory, and with [Prof. Tim Hoheisel](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/hoheisel/) on problems in convex optimization.
